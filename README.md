# CSCI330

These files have been retroactively added after my final project in CSCI 330 that I took in Spring 2020. I got an A on this project, and in the course.

In the course, we added new things to the same program with each project. Earlier projects were incomplete versions of this one.
The professor of this course has retired and this project is no longer used.

Main is located in the test driver, test.cpp, the rest of the files consist of an exercise in polymorphism and "is a" relationships.
